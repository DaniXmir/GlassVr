# GlassVr
glassvr is a way to use XR/AR glasses from xreal, viture etc, with 6dof in steamvr

note: the glasses are running like monitors, so you dont need the fancy ones with 6dof or even 3dof builtin, these features requires special software to be used that varies from manufacturer to manufacturer,
that also means that the screens are mirroring for both eye, not idle for vr but usable,

steamvr isn't designed for a "headset" like this but i found some workarounds...

# Requirements
- glasses that can act like monitors
- base station
- controller or tracker

# Optinal Hardware
