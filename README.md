# GlassVr
glassvr is a way to use XR/AR glasses from xreal, viture etc, with 6dof in steamvr

the glasses are running like monitors, so you dont need the fancy ones with 6dof or even 3dof builtin, these features requires special software to be used that varies from manufacturer to manufacturer,
that also means that the screens are mirroring for both eye, not idle for vr but usable,

steamvr isn't designed for a "headset" like this but i found some workarounds...

# Requirements
- glasses that can act like monitors, for you'r eyes ofcourse
- base station and 1 vr controller(vive, index etc) or 1 vr tracker(vive, Tundra etc), to track your head

note: with something like the vive ultimate tracker you could skip needing base stations, but then you wont be able to track you'r controllers for you hands

# Optinal Hardware
- 2 additional controllers, one for each hand
- steamvr watchman dongles, while not required, needed if you want to use your controllers wirelessly, one per decive

here is a cool video that explains what are dongles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmzmNvJFkSc
